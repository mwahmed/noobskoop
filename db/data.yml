    - This course introduces and provides a framework for the design process. Students
      are introduced to communication as an integral component of engineering practice.
      The course is a vehicle for understanding problem solving and developing communications
      skills. This first course in the two Engineering Strategies and Practice course
      sequence introduces students to the process of engineering design, to strategies
      for successful team work, and to design for human factors, society and the environment.
      Students write team and individual technical reports and give presentations
      within a discussion group.

    - This course formalizes intuitions or how to do engineering design and communication.
      There is a lot of theory about specific design techniques, and effective engineering
      communication. The course tends to get pretty boring, but make sure you understand
      broadly what each technique is about. Both the midterm and the final exam, are
      multiple choice, with a few short/long answer questions.

    - The principles of statics are applied to composition and resolution of forces,
      moments and couples. The equilibrium states of structures are examined. Throughout,
      the free body diagram concept is emphasized. Vector algebra is used where it
      is most useful, and stress blocks are introduced. Shear force diagrams, bending
      moment diagrams and stress-strain relationships for materials are discussed.
      Stress and deformation in axially loaded members and flexural members (beams)
      are also covered.

      few such as the neuromuscular, cardiovascular, and endocrine control systems.
      This course will also provide an introduction to the structures and mechanisms
      responsible for the proper functioning of these systems. This course will combine
      linear control theory, physiology, and neuroscience with the objective of explaining
      how these complex systems operate in a healthy human body. The first part of
      the course will provide an introduction into physiology and give an overview
      of the main physiological systems. The second part of the course will focus
      on the endocrine system and its subsystems, including glucose regulation, thyroid
      metabolic hormones, and the menstrual cycle. The third part of the course will
      include discussion on the cardiovascular system and related aspects such as
      cardiac output, venous return, control of blood flow by the tissues, and nervous
      regulation of circulation. The fourth and final section of the course will focus
      on the central nervous system, the musculoskeletal system, proprioception, kinaesthetic,
      and control of voluntary motion. '

    - New technologies in molecular and cellular biology have allowed the collection
      of unprecedented amounts of biological data ranging from sequences to protein
      structures to gene expression. The need to synthesize knowledge from this abundant
      data is driving the convergence of the biological and computer sciences. This
      course will introduce the fundamental concepts and challenges in molecular biology
      and the computational and statistical approaches applied to model and address
      them. Course topics include basic concepts in molecular and structural biology,
      sequence-based algorithms (such as pairwise and multiple sequence alignment,
      statistical models), structure-based algorithms (such as energy models, homology
      modeling, threading), and systems biology algorithms (such as hierarchal and
      neural network clustering).

    - As computers permeate our society, the security of such computing systems is
      becoming of paramount importance. This course covers principles of computer
      systems security. To build secure systems, one must understand how attackers
      operate. This course starts by teaching students how to identify security vulnerabilities
      and how they can be exploited. Then techniques to create secure systems and
      defend against such attacks will be discussed. Industry standards for conducting
      security audits to establish levels of security will be introduced. The course
      will include an introduction to basic cryptographic techniques as well as hardware
      used to accelerate cryptographic operations in ATM's and webservers.
